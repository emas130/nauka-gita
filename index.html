      <p>My neighbour's knocking and I open carefully He looks a bit like Ronny Jeremy He's screaming at me "damn you little Albatraoz!" While he smells like chips and calvadaoz
      </p>
      <p>
         He said "what the hell is going on, What is the goddamn growl? That ain't no sound of Rock ‘n' Roll" I said "I'm so sorry but I got this thing I have to show That might be good for you to know"
      </p>
      <p>So I brought him inside Don't know why But then suddenly he just passed out I thought well alright, can't deny That I got a llama in my living room A llama in my living room A llama in my, llama in my, llama in my, llama in my,llama in my, llama in my I got a llama in my living room</p>

Then his big arm started to swing I tried to calm him down told him "take it easy now" It's just my llama named "Chow-chow"</p>
      <p>
         Then he raced up, he said "what" I said "I'm sorry but I just can't stop" Now you know what What I got That I got a llama in my living room A llama in my living room A llama in my, llama in my, llama in my, llama in my I got a llama in my living room I got a A llama in my living room I got a (going on) A llama in my living room A llama in my living room</p>
